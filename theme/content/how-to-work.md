<p>Please make an appointment by email to describe your situation and needs in the email, then we will contact you. We need to negotiate and establish the practice and scope of the service and conclude the contract. When the contract comes into effect, we will start working. Our job is to charge by the hour, but we will estimate the time required in advance and write it into the contract price list. If the actual time exceeds the estimated time, the fee will not increase unless you change it. The initial needs. We will subdivide the entire project into several nodes, and each node will continue to the next step after acceptance. If you feel that our service is hopeless, you can terminate the contract at any node.</p>
<p>If you choose an interactive class of services, we can offer you free multi-channel marketing content management software during the contract period. In order to deploy our software, you must purchase a cloud server from a third-party carrier, not just a simple website space. We recommend that you use <a href="https://ucloud.cn" target="_blank">Ucloud</a> products, which will save you the cost of installation and deployment.</p>
